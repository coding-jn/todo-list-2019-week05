## How It's Made

The application primarily uses arrays to store the tasks, and using those arrays there are functions, for loops, and conditionals that are able to run the page. The list is displayed to the user using JavaScript to change the HTML's innerText and innerHTML. 

## What I Learned

While creating the program, the code required a lot of loops and conditional statements so I really had to put my problem solving skills to use. Because the arrays are constantly changing I had to be extra cautious with the order of my code and when/how I stored my data, or else the whole application would run into logical errors.
